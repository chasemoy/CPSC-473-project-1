The Lord of the Rings? Romeo and Juliet? Green Eggs and Ham? Judge people you don't know off of books you haven't read-or maybe you have read them, doesn't matter to us. The power is in your hands. Are they wise? Or are they reading lies?</p>

Once you have chosen a username and entered your email, you will be able to enter the title and a comment for three of your favorite books. How exciting! Next comes the fun part, swiping. If you and someone else both choose each other then you will be notified of your new match. Congratulations! Not everyone thinks you are dumb.</p>
